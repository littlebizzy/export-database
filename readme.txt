Quickly and easily export your WordPress database with a single click for the purposes of migration, testing, or backup (in either SQL or ZIP format).

== Description ==

Export Database is a simple plugin that does one thing only: with a single click you are able to export your WordPress site's database exactly as it exists on the live site.

The first version does not offer any search/replace functions nor is it meant to. It is for developers who need a quick and easy way to either back up their database, migrate to a local or another site, or so forth, without interactive options.

In future versions we may add more options.
