Quickly and easily export your WordPress database with a single click for the purposes of migration, testing, or backup (in either SQL or ZIP format).

== Description ==

Export Database LittleBizzy is a simple plugin that does one thing only: with a single click you are able to export your WordPress site's database exactly as it exists on the live site.

The first version does not offer any search/replace functions nor is it meant to. It is for developers who need a quick and easy way to either back up their database, migrate to a local or another site, or so forth, without interactive options.

In future versions we may add more options.

Compatibility:

* Meant for Linux servers
* Minimum PHP version: 5.5
* Designed for: PHP 7+ and MySQL 5.7+
* Can be used as a "Must Use" plugin (mu-plugins)

Future plugin goals:

* Localization (translation support)
* More features (based on user suggestions)
* Code maintenance/improvements

Code inspired by:

* [WP Migrate DB](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-migrate-db/)
* dozens of code snippets across the web
* custom coding

NOTE: We released this plugin in response to our managed hosting clients asking for better access to their server environment, and our primary goal will likely remain supporting that purpose. Although we are 100% open to fielding requests from the WordPress community, we kindly ask that you consider all of the above mentioned goals before leaving reviews of this plugin, thanks!
